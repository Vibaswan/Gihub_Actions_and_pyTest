# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      main
    paths:
      'VERSION'

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:

      # checking out my code
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # basically just getting the version number for which the build got triggered
      - name: Get version number
        id: get_version
        run: echo "::set-output name=version::$(cat VERSION)"

      # setting up python for the project
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a simple pwd command
      - name: Run pwd command
        run: pwd

      # Installing some dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pytest

      # Running the pytest for testing code
      - name: running the unit test
        run: python -m pytest -s tests
